# aco-robotthread-archiver-bot
a fucking discord parasite designed to post links to robo smut threads on its dedicated channel until its host dies.

requires [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/), moesearch and discord.py, just do `pip3 install moesearch` and `pip3 install https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/archive/rewrite.zip#egg=discord.py`

change your [bot token](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/), discord server name and dedicated robosmut channel on parser.py before running.

if you're gonna have this running in a windows machine, use start.bat to start it. otherwise, use cron to schedule a task so when it crashes it boots back up again on linux.
